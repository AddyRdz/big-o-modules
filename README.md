# Big O Homework

## Instructions 

1. If desired, fork and clone this repo. 
1. Follow along the steps in this README to progress through the myGA modules.
1. When you are finished, submit your assignment by clicking on the issues tab above on this repo and start a [new issue](). 
1. The issue template will ask that you answer three exit ticket questions before submitting your issue, to summarize your learning on this topic.

Unless otherwise noted, homework is due at 10:00 AM ET the next day. 

## Overview

There are three parts to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Intro to Computer Science](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/513)
1. [myGA module: Intro to Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/780)
2. [myGA module: Big O Notation](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/511)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain how Big O notation is used to describe algorithms.
- Define constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and factorial Big O runtimes.
- Analyze algorithms to determine their Big O runtime.

## Prerequisites
- None

Tomorrow morning, we will dive deeper into Big O Notation and use it to evaluate the efficiency of different code samples.
