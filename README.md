# Intro to Computer Science, Algorithms & Big O Notation

Throughout this course, we will use a combination of myGA modules assigned as homework as well as in-class exercises to learn the fundamentals of computer science topics. 

For the myGA modules, focus on grasping the main ideas and larger concepts. The following morning, we will practice applying these ideas to code! 

## Instructions 

1. Follow along the steps in this README to progress through the myGA modules.
1. When you are finished, submit your assignment by clicking on the "Issues" tab above this repo to start a new issue.
1. The issue template will ask that you answer several concept-based, code-free questions before submitting your issue, to summarize your learning on this topic.

Tomorrow morning, we will dive deeper into our approach to CS in this course, algorithms, and Big O notation and use it to evaluate the efficiency of different code samples.

## Overview

There are three parts to this lesson:
